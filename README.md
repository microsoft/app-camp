# Microsoft Teams App Camp On Demand

_Migrate applications into Microsoft Teams_

Welcome to App Camp! In this on-demand workshop, you'll learn how to build Teams applications "from scratch", which is important for developers who already have an application they want to extend into Microsoft Teams, or for developers who have a specific toolchain in mind. If you're starting from scratch and open to building a React application with NodeJS/Express support, we recommend you use the [Teams Toolkit](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/visual-studio-code-overview) rather than building your application from scratch.

## About the app-camp repo

* The /docs/ folder contains [the Teams App Camp web site](https://microsoft.github.io/app-camp) in Markdown format (mkdocs).

* the /src/ folder contains the lab source code. 

    * /src/create-core-app/aad contains the starter application for students starting with Azure AD (the "A" path), which is lab A01, and the finished solutions to the remaining core labs (A02-A03)
    * /src/create/core-app/bespoke contains the starter application for students starting without Azure AD (the "B" path), which is lab B01, and the finished solutions to the remaining core labs (B02-B04)
    * /src/extend-with-capabilities contains the finished solutions for all the "extended" labs assuming they were applied to the "A" path (if the lab is performed following lab A03)

* the /experimental folder contains labs that are based on preview features in the platform

## Prerequisites 📃 

This workshop is intended for developers. Most of the labs don't assume a lot of specialized knowledge; coding is  in JavaScript without use of specialized frameworks or libraries. But if you're not comfortable with coding, you may find it a bit challenging.

Technical prerequisites are explained [in the repo wiki](https://github.com/microsoft/app-camp/wiki/Prerequisites)
